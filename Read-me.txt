Hello.
My name is Daouda BA and I wrote this program because I love to play Scrabble and to make it easier for me when I play,
I thought to myself, why not create a program that takes stock for me?

HOW TO PLAY
->
This program allows you to calculate points when you play Scrabble (The Balance Sheet).
Before starting, you must first give the number of player (s)
and Scrabble is played between 2 players, 3 players or 4 players.
Then after entering the names of the players, we can start the assessment.
At the end, you just have to enter the number 199 to finish the balance sheet and see the results of the game.
